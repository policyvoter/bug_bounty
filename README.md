PolicyVoter looks forward to working with the security community to find security vulnerabilities in order to keep our businesses and users safe.
 
### What are the bounties?
Exploits: These bounties help us identify vulnerabilities in our design and code, especially in our staking and delegation related smart contracts. The goal is to find attack vectors by which an attack can either lead to partial theft of funds or draining of funds from the contract. There may be more attack vectors too, we have just added indicative ones.
 
Reach out to us for any queries:
 
If you have any questions, please join our ???????????????? and post your queries in the Developers->contracts channel: ????? (maybe make a discord channel ?)
 
### Prizes and judging criteria
To be decided at the sole discretion of the PolicyVoter's team.

Judging criteria will take into consideration:
- The criticality of the exploits (e.g., users/cases impacted, size of impact)
- After a submission is tagged as valid, any further similar submissions will not be eligible for prizes.
- After a submission is tagged as valid, any further similar submissions will not be eligible for prizes.
- Please provide detailed reports and reproducible steps. Incorrect report formats will not be eligible for complete review

### Response Targets

PolicyVoter will make a best effort to meet the following response targets for hackers participating in our program:

- | First Response | 2 business days |
- | Time to Triage | 2 business days |
- | Time to Bounty | 5 business days |

Weâ€™ll try to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.

### Disclosure Policy
Please do not discuss this program or any vulnerabilities (even resolved ones) outside of the program without express consent from the organization.
 
### Bounty Rules

Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps. If the report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, the issue will not be eligible for a reward.
Submit one vulnerability per-report, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact.
When duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced).
Multiple vulnerabilities caused by one underlying issue will be awarded one bounty.
Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is not in scope.
Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with the explicit permission of the account holder.


### Out of scope vulnerabilities
When reporting vulnerabilities, please consider (1) attack scenario / exploitability, and (2) security impact of the bug. The following issues are considered out of scope:

- Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on unauthenticated forms or forms with no sensitive actions
- Attacks requiring MITM or physical access to a user's device.
- Previously known vulnerable libraries without a working Proof of Concept.
- Comma Separated Values (CSV) injection without demonstrating a vulnerability.
- Missing best practices in SSL/TLS configuration.
- Any activity that could lead to the disruption of our service (DoS).
- Content spoofing and text injection issues without showing an attack vector/without being able to modify HTML/CSS
- Rate limiting or bruteforce issues on non-authentication endpoints
- Missing best practices in Content Security Policy.
- Missing HttpOnly or Secure flags on cookies
- Missing email best practices (Invalid, incomplete or missing SPF/DKIM/DMARC records, etc.)
- Vulnerabilities only affecting users of outdated or unpatched browsers [Less than 2 stable versions behind the latest released stable version]
- Software version disclosure / Banner identification issues / Descriptive error messages or headers (e.g. stack traces, application or server errors).
- Public Zero-day vulnerabilities that have had an official patch for less than 1 month will be awarded on a case by case basis.
- Tabnabbing
- Open redirect - unless an additional security impact can be demonstrated
- Issues that require unlikely user interaction

### Safe Harbor

Any activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will be considered authorized conduct and we will not initiate legal action against you. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you in connection with activities conducted under this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.
Thank you for helping keep PolicyVoter and our users safe!
